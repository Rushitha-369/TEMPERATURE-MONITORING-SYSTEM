# DESCRIPTION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMED AND WHAT DONE AND PASTE PICTURES OF OUTPUT:
I have collected the basic information and gained the knowledge regarding to the task and the task is temperature-monitoring-system I have learned about the Actuators and Sensors. In embedded systems, sensors and actuators serve as the essential interfaces between the digital system (microcontroller) and the physical world. They allow embedded devices to perceive environmental changes and respond accordingly, making them vital components in automation, robotics, IoT, and control systems.
 I understood that Sensors are input devices that detect and measure physical quantities such as temperature, light, pressure, distance, motion, or gas concentration. They convert these real-world phenomena into electrical signals that a microcontroller can process. Actuators are output devices that convert electrical signals into physical action. While sensors gather data, actuators act on decisions made by the embedded system.
And also explored on the DHT11 helps in environmental sensing and automation tasks like controlling fans, humidifiers, or alarms and LM35 Commonly used for precision temperature monitoring and thermal control systems and also DHT22 Provides higher accuracy and a wider range than DHT11. 
I understand that interfacing sensors with microcontrollers is a fundamental aspect of embedded systems. It involves connecting a sensor to a microcontroller, reading its output, and processing that data to perform a specific task. The method of interfacing depends on the type of sensor (analog or digital) and the communication protocol it uses.
I understand the Temperature sensors play a crucial role in embedded systems because many applications rely on accurate temperature monitoring for safety, performance, energy efficiency, and automation.
Finally performed the task based on the above information and the task  performed based on the temperature sensor to read and display temperature data on an LCD.
